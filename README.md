## Target Browsers
This page should be openable in any browser, but it is designed to be used on a laptop computer. 

## Description of the Project
I used the Ron Swanson Quote Generator API from this website: https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes. This project is game where users can try to finish a random quote that was said by the character Ron Swanson, on the popular TV show, Parks and Recreation. This project uses the form data library to use the data submitted in the form to see if the user got the answer correct or not. I used the CSS framework FlexBox to make the website look good and make it so it is accessable from any browser.
